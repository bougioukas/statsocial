When we have finished this Lab, we should be able to:

## Learning objectives

-   Understand the linear regression model
-   Explore how a factor (independent variable) affect a response (dependent) variable.
-   Interpret the results
:::

In this Lab, we will use the "LungCapacity" dataset.

### Opening the file

Open the dataset named "LungCapacity" from the file tab in the menu:

![The LungCapacity dataset](images/lungcap.png){#fig-lungcap1 width="75%"}

Double-click on the variable name `Age` and change the measure type from nominal ![](images/nominal.png){width="23" height="21"} to continuous ![](images/continuous.png){width="23" height="21"}.

### Research question

Let's say that we want to **model** the association between age (in years) and lung capacity (in liters) for the sample of 725 participants in a survey. In other words, we want to find the parameters of a mathematical equation such as $y = \alpha + \beta \cdot x$.

### Hypothesis Testsing

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis

-   $H_{0}:$ the two variables are not linearly related. There is no effect between age and lung capacity ($β = 0$).

-   $H_{1}:$ the two variables are linearly related. There is an effect between age and lung capacity ($β \neq 0$).

### Scatter plot

We start our analysis by creating the scatter plot of the response variable `LungCap` and the explanatory variable `Age`.

![The Scatter plot of Age and Lung Capacity](images/linear1.png){#fig-linear1 width="65%"}

There is a clear upward trend indicating that increase in `Age` tends to coincide with increase in `LungCap`. Moreover, the trend seems to be linear, so a straight line can capture the overall pattern.

### Linear regression

The process of fitting a linear regression model to the data involves finding a straight line that can be considered as the **best representation** of the overall association between age and lung capacity.

To choose a line, we need to explain what we mean by the "best representation" of the data. A "best-fitting" line refers to the line that **minimizes** the **sum of squared residuals (RSS)**. Therefore, we refer to the resulting model as the least-squares linear regression model and to the corresponding line as the **least-squares regression line**.

### Fit a simple linear regression model

On the Jamovi top menu navigate to

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(Regression) -.-> C(Linear Regression)
```

as shown below (@fig-linear2).

![In the menu at the top, choose Analyses \> Regression \> Linear Regression.](images/linear2.png){#fig-linear2 width="85%"}

The *Linear Regression dialogue box* opens (@fig-linear3). From the left-hand pane drag the variable `LunCap` into the *Dependent Variable* field and the variable `Age` into the *Covariates* field on the right-hand side, as shown below:

![The Linear Regression dialogue box options. Drag and drop the LunCap into the Dependent Variable field and the Age into the Covariates field.](images/linear3.png){#fig-linear3 width="65%"}

Additionally, from the *Model Coefficients* section tick the box "**Confidence interval**" in **Estimate** (@fig-linear4):

![Check the Confidence interval box in the Model Coefficients section.](images/linear4.png){#fig-linear4 width="75%"}

The output table with the model coefficients should look like the following (@fig-linear5):

![The model coefficients table.](images/linear5.png){#fig-linear5 width="75%"}

Now, let's find the model equation from the regression table in @fig-linear5. In the **Estimate** column are the intercept $a=0.54$ and the slope $b=0.26$ for `Age`. Thus, the equation of the regression line becomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{y} &= a + b \cdot x\\
\widehat{\text{LungCap}} &= a + b \cdot\text{Age}\\
\widehat{\text{LungCap}}&= 0.54 + 0.26\cdot\text{Age}
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, the quality of our simple linear model is presented in @fig-linear6:

![The coefficient of determination $R^2$.](images/linear6.png){#fig-linear6 width="35%"}

In our example takes the value 0.67. It indicates that about 67% of the variation in lung capacity can be explained by the variation of the age. In simple linear regression $\sqrt{0.67} = 0.82$ which equals to the Pearson's correlation coefficient, r.

## Interpretation of the results

The regression coefficient (b=0.26) of the `Age` is significantly different from zero (p \< 0.001) and indicates that there's **on average an increase of 0.26 liters** in lung capacity for **every 1 year increase in age**. Note that the $95\%$CI (0.24 to 0.27) **does not** include the hypothesized null value of zero for the slope.
