    "section": "1.2 The discipline of Statistics",
    "text": "1.2 The discipline of Statistics\nThe word “statistics” originates from the Latin “status”. Initially, it referred to the political state of a region, with “statista” used for recording information like censuses or data on a state’s wealth. Over time, the meaning and use of statistics broadened, and its scope evolved.\n\nToday, Statistics is an applied mathematical science that, according to Croxton and Cowden, can be defined as “the science of collection, presentation, analysis, and interpretation of numerical data”.\n\nStatistics includes different theoretical frameworks such as traditional (frequentist) statistics and Bayesian statistics. In this course, we will cover classical parametric and nonparametric statistical tests of traditional statistics.\nRelying heavily on probability theory and empirical methods, statistics aims to describe and summarize data as well as to draw inferences about the population from which the data are derived. Therefore, the discipline of traditional (frequentist) statistics includes two main branches (Figure 1.1):\n\nDescriptive statistics that includes measures of frequency and measures of location and dispersion. It also includes a description of the shape of the data distributions.\nInferential statistics that aims at generalizing conclusions made on a sample to a whole population. It includes estimation and hypothesis testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  \n    A[Traditional &lt;br/&gt; Statistics]--- B[Descriptive statistics]\n    A --- C[Inferential statistics]\n    B --- D[Measures of frequency: &lt;br/&gt; e.g., frequency, percentage.]\n    B --- E[Measures of location &lt;br/&gt; and dispersion: &lt;br/&gt; e.g., mean, standard deviation.]\n    C --- H[Estimation]\n    C --- I[Hypothesis Testing]\n    style A color:#980000, stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n    \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The discipline of statistics and its two branches, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a research study, both descriptive and inferential statistics are commonly used. First, researchers present descriptive statistics (e.g., demographic data, baseline characteristics) to provide a clear snapshot of the sample. Then, inferential statistics are applied to test hypotheses and draw conclusions about the broader population from which the sample was drawn.",

    "text": "1.3 Data and variables\nData in the social and health sciences refers to the information collected and analyzed to understand human behavior, societal structures and interactions. This data originates from various sources, each offering unique insights into different aspects of human and societal dynamics. These sources include:\n\nSelf-Reports:  These are collected through interviews, questionnaires, and surveys, capturing individual experiences, behaviors, and attitudes. They provide qualitative insights that enhance our understanding of personal perspectives and social phenomena.\nInternet and Social Media:  These platforms generate vast amounts of data on online interactions, behaviors, and social trends, offering valuable information on how people communicate and engage in the digital space.\nWearable Technology:  Devices such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, smart glasses, and smart clothing equipped with sensors have become revolutionary tools for tracking and monitoring physiological and behavioral metrics in real-time. They provide critical insights into health, fitness, and daily habits.\nElectronic Health Records (EHRs):  EHRs offer detailed information about patients’ medical histories, treatments, and health outcomes, facilitating research on health trends and the effectiveness of interventions.\nHealth Surveillance Systems:  These systems continuously monitor and analyze trends in real-time, including disease outbreaks, vaccination uptake, public health patterns, substance abuse trends, and crime statistics, thereby informing timely interventions and policy decisions.\nClinical Registries:  These collect data on patients with specific medical conditions or treatments, providing valuable insights into health outcomes and social determinants of health.\nBiobanks:  Biobanks store biological samples (e.g., blood, tissue) along with health and lifestyle data, enabling research into the intersections of genetics, environment, and social factors.\n\nSocial, behavioral, and biomedical data can be transformed into information. This information can evolve into knowledge when social scientists and stakeholders interpret and understand it, allowing them to make informed decisions, shape policies, and implement interventions that address societal and health-related challenges more effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: From data to knowledge and action.",
