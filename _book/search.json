Students will learn to:\n\nDescribe and summarize data distributions.\nFormulate and test various types of research hypotheses.\nAnalyze associations between factors, characteristics, or events.\nInterpret and critically evaluate published statistics.\n\nThe student may also learn about the proper use of graphing and statistical software.",

It includes different theoretical frameworks such as traditional (frequentist) statistics and Bayesian statistics. In this course, we will cover classical parametric and nonparametric statistical tests of traditional statistics.\nThe discipline of traditional (frequentist) statistics includes two main branches (Figure 1.1):\nflowchart LR\n  \n    A[Traditional &lt;br/&gt; Statistics]--- B[Descriptive statistics]\n    A --- C[Inferential statistics]\n    B --- D[Measures of frequency: &lt;br/&gt; e.g., frequency, percentage.]\n    B --- E[Measures of location &lt;br/&gt; and dispersion: &lt;br/&gt; e.g., mean, standard deviation.]\n    C --- H[Estimation]\n    C --- I[Hypothesis Testing]\n    style A color:#980000, stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n    \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The discipline of statistics and its two branches, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics",

    "text": "1.2 Data and variables\nData in the social sciences refers to the information collected and analyzed to understand human behavior, societal structures and interactions. This data can come from a variety of sources, each offering unique insights into different aspects of human and societal dynamics. These sources include:\n\nElectronic Health Records (EHRs): Provide detailed information about patients’ medical histories, treatments, and health outcomes.\nSurveillance Systems: Continuously monitor and analyze trends in real-time, including disease outbreaks, rollout and uptake of vaccinations, public health patterns, substance abuse trends, and crime statistics, to inform timely interventions and policy decisions.\nClinical Registries: Collect data on patients with specific medical conditions or treatments, offering insights into health outcomes and social determinants of health.\nBiobanks: Store biological samples (e.g., blood, tissue) along with health and lifestyle data, helping to study the intersection of genetics, environment, and social factors.\nInternet and Social Media: Generate large volumes of data on online interactions, behaviors, and social trends.\nSelf-Reports: Gather data through interviews, questionnaires, and surveys that capture individual experiences, behaviors, and attitudes, providing qualitative insights that enhance understanding of personal perspectives and social phenomena.\n\nSocial, behavioral, and biomedical data can be transformed into information. This information can evolve into knowledge when social scientists and stakeholders interpret and understand it, allowing them to take informed actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: From data to knowledge.",
