    "section": "1.2 The discipline of Statistics",
    "text": "1.2 The discipline of Statistics\nThe word “statistics” originates from the Latin “status”. Initially, it referred to the political state of a region, with “statista” used for recording information like censuses or data on a state’s wealth. Over time, the meaning and use of statistics broadened, and its scope evolved.\n\nToday, Statistics is an applied mathematical science that, according to Croxton and Cowden, can be defined as “the science of collection, presentation, analysis, and interpretation of numerical data”.\n\nStatistics includes different theoretical frameworks such as traditional (frequentist) statistics and Bayesian statistics. In this course, we will cover classical parametric and nonparametric statistical tests of traditional statistics.\nRelying heavily on probability theory and empirical methods, statistics aims to describe and summarize data as well as to draw inferences about the population from which the data are derived. Therefore, the discipline of traditional (frequentist) statistics includes two main branches (Figure 1.1):\n\nDescriptive statistics that includes measures of frequency and measures of location and dispersion. It also includes a description of the shape of the data distributions.\nInferential statistics that aims at generalizing conclusions made on a sample to a whole population. It includes estimation and hypothesis testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  \n    A[Traditional &lt;br/&gt; Statistics]--- B[Descriptive statistics]\n    A --- C[Inferential statistics]\n    B --- D[Measures of frequency: &lt;br/&gt; e.g., frequency, percentage.]\n    B --- E[Measures of location &lt;br/&gt; and dispersion: &lt;br/&gt; e.g., mean, standard deviation.]\n    C --- H[Estimation]\n    C --- I[Hypothesis Testing]\n    style A color:#980000, stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n    \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The discipline of statistics and its two branches, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a research study, both descriptive and inferential statistics are commonly used. First, researchers present descriptive statistics (e.g., demographic data, baseline characteristics) to provide a clear snapshot of the sample. Then, inferential statistics are applied to test hypotheses and draw conclusions about the broader population from which the sample was drawn.",

    "section": "1.3 Talking about data",
    "text": "1.3 Talking about data\n\n1.3.1 The “Age of data”\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are living in the “Age of Data”, where every day, an astonishing 2.5 quintillion (\\(10^{18}\\)) bytes of data are generated worldwide. An example of how this era is transforming scientific research can be seen in large-scale multi-ancestry genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which are used to uncover the genetic basis of complex conditions like anxiety disorders. In a recent study, researchers analyzed genomic data from more than 1.2 million individuals across diverse populations, identifying more than 100 genes associated with stress and anxiety (Friligkou et al. 2024).\nA second example is chatbots, which are designed to simulate conversations with users. ELIZA (1966) was one such program. Its famous “DOCTOR” script emulated a psychotherapist by rephrasing user statements as questions (Figure 1.2). Modern chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot, are large language models trained on vast amounts of text data (e.g., books, articles, websites, and user-generated content), hence the term “large”. Using deep learning techniques, these models aim to understand and generate human-like text, effectively responding to a wide range of user queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The most famous scenario simulated a psychotherapist of the Rogerian school.\n\n\n\n \nNext is a YouTube video that explores the history of Eliza and chatbots.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Structure of data\nThere are three main data structures:\n\nStructured data generally refer to highly organized tabular data, facilitating straightforward search, analysis, and processing. Examples include data stored in spreadsheets, such as Excel files, or in comma-separated values (CSV) files.\nSemi-Structured data are a form of structured data that do not follow a strict tabular format but still have some organizational properties. For example, emails are semi-structured; they include fields like sender, recipient, subject, date, and time, and are also organized into folders such as Inbox, Sent, and Trash.\nUnstructured data refer to information that lacks a predefined format or organization, such as open text (e.g., social media posts), images, videos, and other forms of multimedia.\n\nIn this course, we use data organized in a structured format, such as spreadsheets. Tabular data refer to data organized in a table with rows and columns (Figure 1.3). Each row represents an observation (or record), corresponding to a statistical unit in the dataset. The columns represent the variables (or characteristics) of interest. Cells are the individual units where rows and columns intersect. Each cell contains a data value corresponding to the observation for that row and the variable for that column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: A typical excel spreadsheet with row and columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Sources of social and health data\nData in the social and health sciences refers to the information collected and analyzed to understand human behavior, societal structures and interactions. This data originates from various sources, each offering unique insights into different aspects of human and societal dynamics. These sources include:\n\nSelf-Reports:  These are collected through interviews, questionnaires, and surveys, capturing individual experiences, behaviors, and attitudes. They provide qualitative insights that enhance our understanding of personal perspectives and social phenomena.\nInternet and Social Media:  These platforms generate vast amounts of data on online interactions, behaviors, and social trends, offering valuable information on how people communicate and engage in the digital space.\nWearable Technology:  Devices such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, smart glasses, and smart clothing equipped with sensors have become revolutionary tools for tracking and monitoring physiological and behavioral metrics in real-time. They provide critical insights into health, fitness, and daily habits.\nElectronic Health Records (EHRs):  EHRs offer detailed information about patients’ medical histories, treatments, and health outcomes, facilitating research on health trends and the effectiveness of interventions.\nHealth Surveillance Systems:  These systems continuously monitor and analyze trends in real-time, including disease outbreaks, vaccination uptake, public health patterns, substance abuse trends, and crime statistics, thereby informing timely interventions and policy decisions.\nClinical Registries:  These collect data on patients with specific medical conditions or treatments, providing valuable insights into health outcomes and social determinants of health.\nBiobanks:  Biobanks store biological samples (e.g., blood, tissue) along with health and lifestyle data, enabling research into the intersections of genetics, environment, and social factors.\n\n\n\n1.3.4 From data to knowledge and decisions\nSocial, behavioral, and biomedical data can be transformed into information. This information can evolve into knowledge when social scientists and stakeholders interpret and understand it, allowing them to make informed decisions, shape policies, and implement interventions that address societal and health-related challenges more effectively (Figure 1.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: From data to knowledge and action.",

    "section": "1.4 Social Statistics",
    "text": "1.4 Social Statistics\nSocial statistics is a field of statistics applied in the social sciences to study social phenomena and trends. It employs various statistical methods of data collection, such as censuses, social surveys, and administrative records. These methods are commonly used by government agencies, institutions, and researchers to analyze data related to social life, human behavior, and society as a whole.\nThe primary goal of social statistics is to provide objective, quantitative evidence that aids in understanding and interpreting social issues, ultimately informing the development of appropriate social policies.\nLet’s take a look at some examples.\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough its quarterly report Greece in Figures, the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) presents current and detailed statistical insights into Greece’s population, social structure, and economy.\nAn important socio-economic indicator at country level is the percentage of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Poverty and social exclusion severely disrupt the lives of those affected, perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage that can last for generations. This cycle not only limits personal growth but also poses significant challenges to social cohesion and economic stability within communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The percentage of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion in Eurozone. Greece (EL) is highlihgted.\n\n\n\nIn 2023, over a quarter (26.1%) of the Greek population was at risk of poverty or social exclusion, ranking Greece (EL) among the highest in the Eurozone, just behind Spain (ES; 26.5%), as shown in Figure 1.5.\n \nExample 2\n\n\n\n\n\nGender inequalities and violence against women and girls are urgent social and public health issues that require immediate attention. A report, based on data from 2018 and published in May 2021, conducted by the World Health Organization, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the South African Medical Research Council, presents findings on the prevalence of violence against women.\nThe report found that the global lifetime prevalence of intimate partner violence among ever-partnered women was 30.0% (95% CI = 27.8% to 32.2%).\n\nIt is important to note that this estimated percentage (30%) is accompanied by a confidence interval (CI), which indicates a range from 27.8% to 32.2%. This interval reflects the precision of the estimate, and we will discuss it further in the subsequent sections of the course.\n\nThe report also mentioned that the prevalence of intimate partner violence among ever-partnered women was highest in the WHO African, Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia Regions with an estimated prevalence of approximately 37%. In contrast, the prevalence was lower in the high-income regions of America (23%) and the European and Western Pacific Regions (25%). This indicates that the prevalence of violence against women can differ significantly among regions, influenced by a range of socio-economic factors. In statistical terms, this suggests that there is a large variance in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report also references the Kirabati case; a country consisting of 33 islands situated in the central Pacific Ocean. The family health study revealed an alarming prevalence of violence against women in Kiribati, with 68% of women aged 15–49 who had been in a relationship reporting experiences of violence (emotional, physical, and/or sexual) from a partner. This finding highlights how social statistics can assist in identifying rare cases (extreme values) to raise global concern and prompt immediate action.\nThe following YouTube video from UN Women is a campaign aimed at raising awareness about violence against women and girls.",
