When we have finished this Lab, we should be able to:

## Learning objectives

-   Understand the concept of correlation of two numeric variables.
-   Compute Pearson's r (or Spearmans $r_{s}$) correlation coefficient between two numeric variables
-   Discuss the possible meaning of correlation that we observe.

In this Lab, we will use the data from "LungCapacity" dataset.(**Note:** This starts by assuming we know how to get data into Jamovi).

### Opening the file

Open the dataset named "LungCapacity" from the file tab in the menu:

![The "LungCapacity" dataset.](images/lungcap.png){#fig-lungcap1 width="85%"}

The dataset "LungCapacity" has 725 participants and includes two variables. The numeric variables of interest are the `Age` and the `LungCap` (@fig-lungcap1). Double-click on the variable name `Age` and change the measure type from nominal ![](images/nominal.png){width="23" height="21"} to continuous ![](images/continuous.png){width="23" height="21"}.

### Research question

Let's say that we want to explore the association between age (in years) and lung capacity (in liters) for the sample of 725 participants in a survey.

### Hypothesis Testsing

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis

-   $H_{0}:$ there is not association between age and lung capacity ($ρ = 0$).

-   $H_{1}:$ there is association between age and lung capacity ($ρ \neq 0$).

### Graphical display with a scatter plot

A first step that is usually useful in studying the association between two continuous variables is to prepare a **scatterplot** of the data. The pattern made by the points plotted on the scatterplot usually suggests the basic nature and strength of the association between two variables.

On the Jamovi top menu navigate to

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(Exploration) -.-> C(Scatterplot)
```

as shown below in @fig-lungcap_scatter1.

![In the menu at the top, choose Analyses \> Exploration ![](images/explor_icon.png){width="35" height="33"} \> Scatterplot.](images/lungcap_scatter1.png){#fig-lungcap_scatter1 width="65%"}

The *Scatterplot dialogue box* opens (@fig-lungcap_scatter3). Transfer the `Age` and `LungCap` variables from the left-hand pane into the *X-Axis* and *Y-Axis* fields on the right-hand side, respectively, by highlighting the variables and pressing the Arrow Button (![](images/right_arrow.png){width="23" height="21"}). Alternatively, drag and drop the variables. Finally, from **Marginals** click on the "**Densities**" radio button. We will end up with the following screen:

![The Scatterplot dialogue box options.](images/lungcap_scatter3.png){#fig-lungcap_scatter3 width="500" height="442"}

The resulting graph looks like this (@fig-lungcap_scatter4):

![The Scatter of Age and Lung Capacity with the marginal density plots](images/lungcap_scatter4.png){#fig-lungcap_scatter4 width="600"}

The above density plots (light blue histograms) show that the data are approximately **normally distributed** for both `Age` and `LungCap` (we have a large sample so the graphs are reliable).

Additionally, the points in the scatter plot seem to be scattered around an invisible **line**. The scatter plot also shows that, in general, older participants tend to have higher lung capacity (**positive association**).

The Pearson's correlation coefficient can quantify the strength of this linear association (alternative is Spearman's correlation coefficients).

 

### Applying the Pearson's correlation coefficient, r

Running correlation in Jamovi requires only a few steps once the data is ready to go. In the top menu navigate to:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(Regression) -.-> C(Correlation Matrix)
```

as shown below in @fig-lungcap_scatter5.

![In the menu at the top, choose Analyses \> Regression ![](images/reg_icon.png){width="35" height="33"} \> Correlation Matrix.](images/lungcap_scatter5.png){#fig-lungcap_scatter5 width="75%"}

The *Correlation Matrix dialogue box* opens (@fig-lungcap_scatter7). Transfer both `Age` and `LungCap` variables from the left-hand pane into the right-hand pane by highlighting the variables and pressing the Arrow Button (![](images/right_arrow.png){width="23" height="21"}). Additionally, from the *Correlation Coefficients* choices we can select between the following three options: Pearson's, Spearman, or Kendall's coefficient. We keep the default choice of "**Pearson**". Finally, from **Additional Options** check "**Flag significant correlations**" and the "**Confidence Intervals**" boxes. We will end up with the following screen:

![The Correlation Matrix dialogue box options. Drag and drop the **Age** and **LungCap** into the right-hand pane. Check the boxes of interest in the additional options.](images/lungcap_scatter7.png){#fig-lungcap_scatter7 width="65%"}

The output table should look like the following (@fig-lungcap_cortable):

![The correlation matrix table.](images/lungcap_cortable.png){#fig-lungcap_cortable width="50%"}

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Interpretation of the results

There is evidence of a **very strong, positive, linear** association between **Age** and **Lung Capacity** (r= 0.82, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.84, p \< 0.001) which is significant.
