## Data

We will explore a dataset containing 258 participants (rows) and 8 variables (columns). The variables include sex (female/male), age (in years), time spent on the internet and social media (in hours), the total score (0-30) from responses to 10 questions on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale ([RSES](https://socy.umd.edu/about-us/using-rosenberg-self-esteem-scale)), and the categorization of that score into three levels: low (0-15), medium (16-19), and high (20-30) level of self-esteem [@garcía2019].

## Summarizing categorical data (Frequency Statistics)


### One variable tables

The first step in analyzing a categorical variable is to count the occurrences of each label and calculate their frequencies. The resulting collection of these frequencies for all possible categories is known as the **frequency distribution** of the variable. We can also express the frequencies as **proportions** of the total number of observations, which are called relative frequencies or **percentages** (%).


**Sex variable**

Let's create a a frequency table for the `sex` variable:

![frequency table for the sex variable.](images/tb001.png){#fig-tb001 width="65%"}

The table displays the following:

-   **Absolute frequency (n):** The number of participants in each category (male: 109, female: 149).

-   **Percentage (%):** The proportion of participants in each category relative to the total number of participants (relative frequency) multiplied by $100\%$ (male: $109/258 \times 100\% = 42.2\%$, female: $149/258 \times 100\% = 57.8\%$).

-   **Cumulative percentage (%):** The sum of the percentage contributions of all categories up to and including the current one (male: 42.2%, male plus female: 42.2% + 57.8% = 100%).

Note that the percentages in both "$\%$" and "$cum\%$" columns of the table sum up to 100%.

 

**Score_cat variable**

Similarly, we can create the frequency table for the `Score_cat` variable:

![Frequency table for the the levels of self-esteem variable](images/tb002.png){#fig-tb002 width="65%"}

In the above table, we observe that 40.3% (104 out of 258) of participants have low level of self-esteem.


 

### Two variable tables (Contingency tables)

**A. Frequency contingency table**

In addition to tabulating each categorical variable separately, we might be interested in the distribution of self-esteem levels (categorized as low, medium, and high) among male and female participants in the dataset. 
This can be achieved by creating a frequency **contingency table**, as shown in @fig-tb0. Each cell value in the table represents the number of occurrences (or frequency) corresponding to the combination of categories from the two different variables.


![Frequency contingency table. Each cell value in the table represents the count corresponding to the combination of categories from the two variables.](images/tb0.png){#fig-tb0 width="65%"}

**Note:** The table also typically includes **row and column totals**, also known as marginal totals, that sum the counts for each row and column,  respectively.

 

**B. Joint distribution contingency table**

A **joint distribution** contingency table displays both the frequency of observations across categories of two variables and the **percentage distributions** of those frequencies. The percentages are calculated by dividing the frequency in each cell by the **overall total** (258), then multiplying the result by 100. This shows the percentage of the total observations that fall into each category combination.

![Joint distribution contingency table. The percentages are calculated by dividing the frequency in each cell by the overall total.](images/tb1.png){#fig-tb1 width="75%"}



 


**C. Conditional distribution contingency table**

Suppose we are interested in the distribution of self-esteem for each sex. Since we are **conditioning** on sex, we divide each cell's frequency by the corresponding **row total** (row marginal total), rather than the overall total. This approach allows us to observe the conditional distribution of self-esteem levels within each sex group.
For example, the percentage of participants with low-level self-esteem, given that the participant is female, is approximately (78/149) x 100 ≈ 52.3\%. 

![Conditional distribution contingency table. The percentages are calculated by dividing the frequency in each cell by the row marginal total.](images/tb2.png){#fig-tb2 width="75%"}

This data indicates notable differences in self-esteem levels between male and female participants. Specifically, the percentage of female participants with low self-esteem (52.3%) is substantially greater than that of male participants (23.9%).
